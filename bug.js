```javascript
//Incorrect usage of $in operator with an empty array
db.collection.find({field: {$in: []}});
//This query will return an empty array, even if there are documents in the collection.
//Correct usage:
//if you want to return all the documents in the collection use this
db.collection.find({});
//else if you want to return documents where the field is not present use this
db.collection.find({field: {$exists: false}});
```
